ðŸš€ Unlocking Actionable Insights: Analyzing Attrition Through Data ðŸš€

I recently completed a data-driven project on HR Analytics, exploring employee attrition trends to uncover patterns that can drive strategic retention initiatives. With a passion for data analysis, I took a systematic approach to help organizations better understand and improve employee engagement and retention.

My Approach:

Using an interactive dashboard, I analyzed the workforce across key dimensions: age, salary, job roles, education, and tenure. My goal was to dig beneath the surface and reveal the deeper trends contributing to employee turnover.

Key Findings:

ðŸ”¹ Age Group Impact: The 26-35 age group had the highest attrition, with 116 employees leaving. This group may face career growth challenges or transition-related decisions.

ðŸ”¹ Salary Influence: Employees earning up to 5K were most affected by attrition (163 employees), indicating that compensation plays a major role in turnover.

ðŸ”¹ Job Roles at Risk: Roles like Laboratory Technicians (62) and Sales Executives (57) had higher attrition, pointing to a potential need for targeted engagement and support strategies.

ðŸ”¹ Tenure Trends: Employees with 1 year of experience showed the highest attrition (54), which significantly drops as tenure increases. Retention strategies should focus on supporting newer employees early on.

Results & Conclusion:

This analysis offers clear directions for improving retention strategies. 

Organizations can focus on:

Addressing younger employees' growth aspirations, Enhancing compensation packages, and Offering stronger support for roles at higher risk of attrition.

By tackling these key areas, businesses can foster a more engaged, loyal workforce, ultimately reducing turnover.

ðŸ“Š Data has the potential to transform business decisions, and this project reaffirmed my belief in its power. Using Power BI, I was able to derive meaningful insights that can guide impactful workforce strategies.
